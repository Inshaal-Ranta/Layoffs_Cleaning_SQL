# Layoffs_Cleaning_SQL
In this project I used a csv file on **layoffs** around the world from 2020 to 2023. I uploaded the csv to SQL (MySQL) with the intention to clean the csv.
A staging table was created in order to protect the raw data, and from that table **Duplicates** were removed, Data was **Standardized**, **Null Values** were dealt with ( some populated, some deleted) and **unwanted columns** were removed, in order to create a version of the data that could be explored analytically.
